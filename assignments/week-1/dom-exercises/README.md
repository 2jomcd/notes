# Exercises for DOM 

## 1 of 3: Sort My Dom
#### Use the DOM API to…
- open a new file in Sublime and write the code to create the DOM in “firstFile.html”.
- copy the HTML code (below) for firstFile.html and paste it into a file called "firstFile.html". Then load this file in a browser. Now use the DOM API to change the code in firstFile.html to resemble the code in secondFile.html. 

```html 
//firstFile.html
<body>
  <section>
    <h1>update my list<h1>
    <ul>
      <li>first</li>
      <li>second</li> 
      <li>third</li>
      <li>third</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
</body>
```

```html
// secondFile.html
<body>
  <section>
    <h1>update my list<h1>
    <ul>
      <li>first</li>
      <li>second</li>
      <li>third</li> 
      <li>fourth</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
</body>
```
