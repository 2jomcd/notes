# Culture

At GA, the students and instructors are a community. We embrace certain cultural values, among which are:

- Fun: Have fun in the course!
- Competition: Don't compete with others - compete with yourself. Don't challenge others - challenge yourself
- Resourcefulness: The longer you participate in the course, the more you will have to look up and try on your own. This will teach you to work independently and to not rely on the instructors after the course. However, if you really try hard and still cannot figure something out, you can of course come to the instructors for help
- Helpfulness: Be helpful and support each other!
