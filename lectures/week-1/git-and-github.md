Collaboration can be hard on a technological level. Merging changes different team members make as well as analyzing how the code of your software developed over time poses a critical problem that has to be solved.

# Educate and Engage & Active Learning
## Assignment
Pair up in groups of two. Independently create a file in code/git/git-example.html with the following contents:

```html
<html>
<head>
	<title>Git Example</title>
</head>
<body>
This is the first line.
###
</body>
</html>
```

Now replace the three hashes with whatever you would like. A simple sentence is good enough. Once done, send the file to your partner in an email. Have him manually merge the changes with his sentence and send it back to you. Both of you should update your file with the new version of the code.

See how hard this was? There has to be an easier way: Git.

## Is Git installed?
Try

```shell
$ git
```

If you get instructions on how to use Git, you are good to go. If you get an error, follow [these instructions](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#Installing-on-Mac). Once done, try the above command again to see if it works.
